###ThreeJS Collision Detection Example

  - Animated Character Creation
  - Keyboard Movement
  - Collision Detection

Collision detection can go from being very simple, in 2.5d worlds to being fairly complex.  I've found that
the two most important aspect are that 1. We dont' walk through walls or other players and 2. We don't fall in
holes.  3rd, it would be nice if we stay level with the terrain and don't fall in any holes[Markdown site] [1]:
